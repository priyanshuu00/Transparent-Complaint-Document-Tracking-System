# Transparent Complaint & Document Tracking System
### Anti-Corruption & Delay Reduction Platform

---

## Project Summary

This project is a transparency-focused digital platform that tracks every citizen complaint and document request from submission to completion using **fixed costs, predefined workflows, SLA-based time tracking, automated delay escalation, and QR-verified digital outputs**.

The system ensures citizens always know:
- What stage their request is in
- Who is responsible
- How long it should take
- Whether it is delayed

This platform does **not replace government systems**. It acts as a **transparency and accountability layer** over existing processes.

---

## Core Objectives
- Reduce corruption caused by hidden fees
- Eliminate uncertainty in processing timelines
- Make delays visible and accountable
- Prevent fake documents using QR verification
